# PreSveltation Copy

Just a copy of <https://github.com/bennymi/presveltation> with some minor tweaks

To setup math in MDsveX, I followed instructions here:

<https://mdsvex-math-starter.vercel.app/>

It is deployed here: <https://presveltation-temp01.vercel.app/example/00-intro.html>

Struggling a bit with figuring out how to customize the Tailwind Typography plugin.
